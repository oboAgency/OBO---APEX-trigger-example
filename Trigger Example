// Triggers execute when a record of a certain type is changed
// Each trigger will work on one object type that is declared when the trigger is created
// You can declare before or after insert, update and delete
// Records that fire the after trigger are read only
// If you need the record id you would have to use the after trigger
// 
// Triggers should be short and not have logic in them. Everything should be passed to a helper class.
// Triggers need to have at least 1% of the code tested

trigger ExampleTrigger on Account (before insert, before update) {
	ExampleClass.example(Trigger.NEW); 								// All records in a before trigger will be stored in Trigger.NEW
    															                  // It is important to bulkify every trigger. There will be times multiple records will be inserted or updated at once
}
